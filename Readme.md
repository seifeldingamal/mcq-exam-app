# MCQ App
I was required to develop an application that allows students to enroll MCQ exams with tracing their scores.

## Requirements:
- In the first touch with the app it will prompt the student to provide his name.
- After Providing his name and submit, he will enroll the exam to see the first question.
- Each question will be rendered separately.
- For each question there are 4 choices. The correct one is randomly ordered among them.
- Use mongodb and node.js for the backend. The questions bank should have at least 10 questions but it will randomly select 5 of them for each exam enrollment.
- The questions are being rendered in a random order. i.e. each time you will enroll in the exam you will have them (The questions) in a random order.
- The choices of every question are rendered in a random order as well. If the same question had been selected for two exams, the choices will be shuffled and ordered in a random way.
- Do not store any generic data in a component state. All global data must be stored in a Redux store.
- Once the student finishes the exam he enrolled (which is only five questions) he will be notified with the score he got through the next rendered component.
- NOTE: Do not have any complex scenarios thatâ€™s not mentioned here. No login. No Signup. No scenarios which are not mentioned here.
- Optional: Use Ant.design or react bootstrap for UI components or whatever you see.

## To start Application

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm i`
### `npm run server`
### `npm run client`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
